### Creation of a Comprehensive Recap Training in Python, SQL, and Java
[Python](https://github.com/Gogo-IGM-BK/Python-Data) | [SQL](https://github.com/Gogo-IGM-BK/SQL) | [Java](https://github.com/gogosmo/Java-Backend)

Throughout my journey, I have developed a comprehensive training program that summarizes my knowledge and skills in Python, SQL, and Java. This training covers the essential aspects of these programming and data management languages.

- Python: I have delved deep into Python's capabilities, including data analysis, data manipulation, charting, and implementing machine learning algorithms using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

- SQL: I have mastered SQL queries to interact with relational databases, efficiently extracting and processing data for in-depth analyses.

- Java: I have gained strong expertise in Java development, working on software projects and using object-oriented programming concepts to create robust and scalable applications.

This recap training aims to share my knowledge and assist other professionals in gaining a thorough understanding of these languages and their practical applications.

Feel free to reach out to me to learn more about this training or to discuss its details.

### UGEOverFlow Project @ Gustave Eiffel University Paris 2023



- As part of the UGEOverFlow project at Gustave Eiffel University in 2023, we developed a university alternative to StackOverflow for the University.

- This project involved designing a web application based on the MVC architecture using the Spring framework, with the integration of Spring Data, Spring MVC, and Spring Security modules.

- We implemented Thymeleaf for template management and complemented it with the use of JavaScript and jQuery for client-side dynamics.

- Additionally, we adopted Hibernate as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for optimized interaction with the H2 database, which served for data storage and management.

- The project aimed to address the specific needs of the university by providing a question-and-answer platform tailored to its academic and research requirements.
